In this article I wanted to share tools, tricks I use everyday and "command line" oriented

# The basic : psql

Ok that's something you probably know... but why do I need to know `psql` ?
You already ended up on a machine where you only have vi or nano to edit files ?
That's exactly the same here, you have to know a few psql tricks to survive there too.

## DATABASE_URL

First if you have environnement variable like the `DATABASE_URL` (Ã  la heroku) you don't have to split the url into its components to run psql against the db

```
psql postgresql://user:password@host.zone.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/demo
```

Note that pg_dump also support that but a bit differently

```
pg_dump -Fc -v --no-acl --no-owner --dbname=$DATABASE_URL -f myapp.dump
```

## Finding your way

To discover the databases, tables,... you have plenty of commands like these

```
\l+             listing databases
\d+             listing tables and views
\d+ <<table>>   listing columns, indexes, foreign keys constraints, partitions, triggers
```

Example output of details about a table

```
                                             Partitioned table "public.certificate"
    Column    |  Type   | Collation | Nullable |                 Default                 | Storage  | Stats target | Description

 issuer_ca_id | integer |           | not null |                                         | plain    |              |
 certificate  | bytea   |           | not null |                                         | extended |              |

    "c_subject_sha1" btree (digest(x509_name(certificate), 'sha1'::text))

            certificate_2024andbeyond FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01 00:00:00') TO (MAXVALUE)

```

## Pager : more is less

You can disable the pager (less)

Inside psql

```
\pset pager 0
```

Before launching psql

```
export PAGER=
psql
```

but another cool thing is replacing the default PAGER `less` with [pspg](https://github.com/okbob/pspg)

![pspg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okbob/pspg/master/screenshots/pspg-4.3.0-mc-export-111x34.png)

This open a lot of possibilities (navigation, search, export)

## Getting further with psql

There are plenty of articles on the web to learn a lot of things about psql

- [cheatsheets](https://gist.github.com/philippetedajo/91341cb4d14c7b07e381d70839acf0f5)
- [psql tips](https://psql-tips.org/psql_tips_all.html) (100+ tips)
- [psql tips](https://pgdash.io/blog/postgres-psql-tips-tricks.html) (timings, null,...)

# The coolkid : pgcli

Friends don't let their friends write join conditions... tell them to use pgcli autocompletion ;)

Think of [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/) as a psql on steroid, exploring the schema/data is 200% easier (Some stuff are still better in psql, ex dumping a lot of data). It's a python package easy to install (once you know a bit of python).

The autocomplete is just great, pgcli will proposed you join conditions based on foreign key constraints.

![pgcli](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/371692/203144054-89a09739-51d5-452d-a9be-ebdb2ee727e2.png)

Want a `heroku psql -a ...` but for launching pgcli ? Add this bash function in your .bashrc

```bash
pgh() {
    pgcli $(heroku config:get DATABASE_URL --app "$1")
}
```

Then just pass the app as parameter

```
pgh myherokuapp
```

Note that if you have other database to support (mysql, mssql) there are other cli tool [here](https://www.dbcli.com/)

## Pager

You'll need to config changes to make `pspg` work with pgcli : https://github.com/okbob/pspg#pgcli

# Gaining visibility

If you connect your self to the production database, it's probably that something isn't working as expected.
Let's see our options here.

## pg_stat_activity

My app is super slow, my ruby/python/java process just blow up...
You probably want to answer the question 'what is running right now in postgres' ?

Want a cool trick to take csv snapshots of the queries ?

```
psql -h crt.sh -p 5432 -U guest certwatch -c "COPY (select * from pg_stat_activity) TO STDOUT WITH CSV HEADER"
```

In my current work, I've combined a few tools to get a feeling of "what's running" when we have problems :

- thread stack (jstack, signal for ruby process,...), logs, http logs, top
- the queries on postgres

and generally this give a few supsects to investigate (no need of pricey apm ;)).

## pg_stat_statements

Ok you missed it ? May be you should keep some planning and execution statitics and analyze them afterwards.

[pg_stat_statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html) is the answer.

Enabling it a bit of work but clearly worth it

- install the postgres-contrib package (if necessary, it's pre installed on rds)
- change `shared_preload_libraries` and `track_activity_query_size` to load the libraries
  - either in postgres.conf
  - or via parameter group in AWS RDS (that the less fun part, you need a custom parameter group for each version of postgres you want to support)
- create the extension
- profit
  - find queries
  - reset/replay the use case to find the sqls emitted

If you want to go further check the [crunchydata article](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/tentative-smarter-query-optimization-in-postgres-starts-with-pg_stat_statements)

## Ok that's nice but do you have a tool like top ?

Tired of running, refreshing your psql prompt to hunt the bad sql ?
No problem there's a top like tool called [pg_activity](https://github.com/dalibo/pg_activity) (note that it plays well with rds)
He will refresh regularly, allow to cancel or kill selected backend connections.

At the top of the screen you will get a sense of the load on the db then bellow you get a list of the running queries.
